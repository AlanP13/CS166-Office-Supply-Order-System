# CS166-Office-Supply-Order-System
The project aimed to design a system to handle office orders for the CS 116 course, which would include a unique order ID, customer ID, product ID, order date, and amount. The system was designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and included error-checking mechanisms. It also had features for tracking inventory, monitoring stock levels, and generating reports on sales and inventory management. The project required technical skills in database design, programming, and user interface design, and was developed using tools such as SQL, Java, HTML, and CSS. Overall, the successful completion of the project provided an efficient and effective solution for managing supply orders and improving productivity and efficiency.
